# 007 — What is a scientifically defensible system-specific biological-age report?

- **scope:** adult longevity/healthspan wellness reporting for this repository,
  with a 2026-08-31 evidence check; not a diagnosis or clinical device claim.
- **status:** current
- **verified:** 2026-08-31
- **decision it feeds:** the final report shape, terminology, measurement map,
  and evidence gate for showing system-specific age-equivalent estimates.

## Gap statement

Entry 005 covered the engineering category schema and the rule that category
ages are withheld. It did not define the scientific meaning of chronological
age, distinguish a system age from a universal biological age, specify the
measurement/provenance fields that a finished card needs, or correct the
strength of the example's claims about DXA, VO2 max, immune markers, and
commercial panels. This entry addresses that gap.

## Answer

Chronological age should be calculated from date of birth and the assessment
reference date, and displayed as context. Biological age has no accepted
universal gold-standard test. A system-specific age is best presented as a
**named age-equivalent estimate**: the output of a specified model for a
specified system, measurement protocol, target, reference population, and
uncertainty method.

The final product should show a profile with:

- assessment date, chronological age, measurement dates, source, units, and
  protocol/device;
- current measurements and missing measurements for each system;
- reference-band direction and a conservative interpretation;
- a numeric system age only when the system has its own validated model and
  approval record; otherwise a typed `withheld_unvalidated` age report;
- uncertainty, model/panel identifiers, subgroup support, and completeness;
  and
- a non-prescriptive next step that does not promise a lower age, longer life,
  disease prevention, or treatment effect.

The example's direction is useful as a user-interface metaphor, but its exact
values must remain mock data. DXA is useful for areal bone mineral density and
body-composition compartments, but it is not an exact universal measure of
muscle age or visceral fat. Direct VO2peak testing is an important
cardiorespiratory-fitness measure, but it is not by itself a whole-body age.
hs-CRP and T-cell ratios are context-dependent markers, not standalone immune
age tests. Cognitive performance and MRI volumetrics are different constructs.
Commercial laboratory panels may provide measurements, but a proprietary score
is not validated merely because a company calls it biological age.

For this repository, the recommended final shape is recorded in
[`SYSTEM_AGE_REPORT_SPEC.md`](../SYSTEM_AGE_REPORT_SPEC.md). The current
implementation should continue to show category coverage and reference
interpretation while keeping unvalidated numeric category ages null.

The implementation sequence is: freeze card identifiers and safe withheld
output; approve each domain's protocol, provenance, reference panel, and
repeatability plan; fit and package one model per approved domain; validate
each domain independently for calibration, uncertainty, subgroup support, and
missingness; then release only the cards with complete evidence and human
approval. The illustrative 45-year-old values are mock presentation values,
not defaults, normative values, or evidence for this repository.

The machine-readable starting point for that review is
[`SYSTEM_AGE_MODEL_MANIFEST_TEMPLATE.json`](../SYSTEM_AGE_MODEL_MANIFEST_TEMPLATE.json).
It is deliberately a non-approving template: `numeric_allowed` is false,
`point_estimate` and `interval` are null, and approval remains
`not_submitted`/`production_ready: false` until a real domain evidence package
is reviewed.

## 2026-10-19 model compatibility audit

A current model audit identified a 2026 NHANES paper with sex-stratified KDM
estimates for whole-body, heart, liver, and kidney constructs. None is runnable
from this app's current 35-field schema. The exact missing biomarkers,
reproducibility limits, and reference-interval gap are recorded in the
[domain-age compatibility matrix](../DOMAIN_AGE_MODEL_COMPATIBILITY_2026-10-19.md).
The paper's reported MAE is a population performance metric, and its age-gap
sign is not an age/sex-matched clinical range. Joint age is not among its
models. Numeric domain ages and reference intervals remain withheld pending a
complete compatible panel, a frozen/reproducible model, patient-level
uncertainty, a separately established reference distribution, external and
subgroup validation, and required review.
